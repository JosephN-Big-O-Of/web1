          <h2>The Internet: a thing so commonly used nowadays</h2>
          <p>
            The Internet is, in the present day, a very commonly present library
            of links available at your fingertips. Some might even say it's a
            necessity. But how did we get here?
          </p>

          <h3>The Past</h3>
          <p>
            It all started in the 1950's, where computers with barely any memory
            were taking up whole rooms. Soon enough, progress took over and we
            were already having proper compilers, programs and the likes in the
            60's. ARPANET was the first successful networking project and in
            1969 the first message was typed and sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this was all experimental and for private (like ARPANET) or
            military use mostly. The first commercial hyperlinked applications
            (so the definition of a "web") started appearing in the 1980's, and
            as the chains of accessibility were to be broken, the first web
            browser -the "World Wide Web"- was created by 1989(Tim Berners-Lee,
            1989).
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the next couple of years, he worked on to making different
            protocols and languages, namely HTTP and HTML, to lay the base for
            the first ever proper web system, and founded the W3C. Following his
            creation, Mosaic was released in 1993, and in 1994 Netscape released
            their own browser, widely used then. Microsoft proceeded on to
            releasing their own browser, taking upwards to 75% of the market due
            to their bundling of the browser with Windows, marking the start of
            the <strong>Browser Wars</strong> between them and Netscape. In that
            meantime, HTML was progressing through different iterations and
            changes, such as HTML 4.0 or nearly being replaced by XHTML in the
            90's.

          <h3>The Present</h3>
          <p>
            Following the war, many competitors emerged against Windows'
            Internet Explorer, such as Opera, Safari and Chrome through the 90's
            and 2000's. Netscape renamed their browser to Mozilla within that
            period, and Internet Explorer became Microsoft Edge in 2015. Many
            browsers with different benefits are nowadays available to all users
            with different tastes and needs. Meanwhile, the W3C adapted in 2014
            HTML5 as the universally admitted markup language for websites, and
            has been used ever since.

          <h3>The Future</h3>
          <p>
            Progress is inevitable, but it seems that HTML5 at it's core is here
            to stay. Updates are being applied to browsers to improve overall
            user experience, which seems to be the main focus for now. Who knows
            what the future holds?

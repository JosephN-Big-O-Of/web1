    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Over the years, phone usage has become a very common thing. Mobile-First
      Development is a way to ensure the compatibility of any apps and websites
      with small screens such as smartphones and tablets, and to make sure all
      users get the proper same experience (also known as UX). Mobile first was initially proposed in 2009 by Luke Wroblewski, Google's Product Director. In his book Mobile First, Wroblewski (2009) explains that designing web products starting with the desktop version is becoming a backward way of thinking about design.

      <h3>Principles and how to apply it</h3>
      <p>
        Phones and tablets are nowadays so commonly available that MFD has
        become a required marketing strategy. Here is what to focus on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it simple</li>
        <li>
          Visual Hierarchy - Users should see the content first and foremost
          easily
        </li>
        <li>Use lesser effects and less complex images</li>
        <li>Design text for small screens first</li>
      </ul>

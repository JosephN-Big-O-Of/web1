      <h1>The History of the Web</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          The Internet is, in the present day, a very commonly present library
          of links available at your fingertips. Some might even say it's a
          necessity. But how did we get here?

        <h2>The Past</h2>
        <p>
          It all started in the 1950s, where computers with barely any memory
          were taking up whole rooms. Soon enough, progress took over and we
          were already having proper compilers, programs and the likes in the
          60s. ARPANET was the first successful networking project and in 1969
          the first message was typed and sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this was all experimental and for private or military use mostly.
          The first commercial hyperlinked applications started appearing in the
          1980s, and as accessibility grew, the first web browser – the "World
          Wide Web" – was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.

        <h2>The Present</h2>
        <p>
          Following the war, many competitors emerged against Internet Explorer,
          such as Opera, Safari and Chrome. Netscape became Mozilla, and IE
          transformed into Microsoft Edge in 2015. Meanwhile, HTML5 was adopted
          in 2014 and remains the core markup language today.

      <section>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          Progress is inevitable, but HTML5 at its core is here to stay. Browser
          updates continue to focus on improving user experience. Who knows what
          the future holds?
